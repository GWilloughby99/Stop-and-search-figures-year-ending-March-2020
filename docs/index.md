# Specific ethnic groups are stopped and searched more than others

**BAME groups are more likely to be stopped by the West Midlands and Metropolitan Police Force areas**

Latest figures from the [Home Office](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/police-powers-and-procedures-england-and-wales-year-ending-31-march-2020) show the ethnicities of people stopped and searched by police force area. 

**West Midlands Police** carried out **37,165** searches and **over a quarter** of those stopped were Asian.

# A problem across BAME groups

Across all the police force areas in England and Wales, nearly **one in five** people stopped and searched were Black.

In the Metropolitan Police Force area, **268,384** searches were carried out - **73,654** of which were Black people. 

This works out to be **over a quarter** of searches and considerably higher in comparison to the other forces.

# Why are the figures concerning?

revealed that year ending March 2020, **577,054 searches** took place.

White people remained the most common group to be stopped and searched. Out of the 557,054 searches, **274,265** were people of white ethnicity.

This is over half but [white people make up a greater percentage](https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/uk-population-by-ethnicity/national-and-regional-populations/population-of-england-and-wales/latest) of the population in England and Wales.

A better way of analysing the numbers is the rate per 1,000.

Annually, stop and searches for all Black, Asian and ethnic minorities (BAME) have been increasing.

The rate of Black people being stopped increased from 39 to 54, as well as Asian figures rising from 11-15. Overall, the rate of BAME groups has increased from 18 through 2018-19, to 25 during 2019-2020.
